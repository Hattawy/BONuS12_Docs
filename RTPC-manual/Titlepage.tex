\begin{abstract}
	This document provides an overview of the Radial Time Projection Chamber (RTPC) system and serves as an Operations Manual for the detector. Instructions are provided for shift takers related to the basic steps of operating and monitoring the HV controls, monitoring the detector system and responding to alarms, and knowing when to contact the on-call personnel. More complete details are also provided for RTPC system experts regarding the channel mapping to the readout electronics, the cable connections and routing in Hall B, LV controls, and detector servicing. This document also provides references to the available RTPC documentation and a list of personnel authorized to perform RTPC system repairs and to modify system settings.
